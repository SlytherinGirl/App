            <p>"Violet! Today let's go to the mall!" Ella said, jumping on my bed.
                "Alright!" I yawned as I got off from bed. We went to eat breakfast and we left the house. "Ella, we forgot to ask mom!"
                "About what?"
                "That we're going somewhere,"
                "but, your 18."
                "I know," I said. "But I have to,"  I said as I got my phone and started to call mom.
                "Hey, do you see that?" Ella asked. I nodded. "Ummm..."
                "what?"
                "Can we go inside there?"
                "No way!" I said as I called mom. "Yeah okay, okay, what? Why, okay, but Ella is whinging to go, okay. Ok. Bye." I said in the call.
                "What happened?" Ella asked.
                "Nothing, we just have to go back home."
                "Why? Call dad! He will agree, won't he?"
                "No, and they will get into a fight!" I said. Ella nodeded. "Okay, now let's go," I said scarsticly weird, but then Ella just ran anyways. "Ella!" I yelled.
                "No! I won't listen to you! Someone wil have to go inside!" Ella scremed as she went inside. I tried to her in like 'Ella I will give you 20$' 'Ella I won't tell mom anything', but nothing worked!
                "Ella please! Don't leave!"
                "Bye!" Ella yelled.
                "Bye," I said looking at her dispappered in that pastel poral. I walked back to the house-
                I just ran to Ridha's house where she she lived with Kaitlyn, Liza, Aubrey, Joise, Irene, Lorenzo, Lillian, Charlotte, Brynn, and Vivian. When I went inside:
                "Oh hello Violet! You look... uh tired."  Vivian said as she opened the door for me.
                "Yeah, actullay Ella-"
                "What? Ella!" Vivian got shocked for a moment.
                "She went to this poral!" I said.
                "Oh no! This is bad that I ever thought! Did you call your mom?"
                "Ummm... Yes! I did then she went!" I yelled. Vivian gave a nod on me."Can I come in?"
                "Sure! I'll bring Ridha!" Vivian said as she was going to to the living room-
                "No!" I yelled.
                "Sorry, I mean no way," 
                "Why?" Vivian asked.
                "I just don't her here right now and she always make a fuss about stuff. You know." I said. "I wished to tell her, but no."
                "Oh yeah, that's true, but I'm goin' to send you in here queitly!" Vivian whispered and we got inside the house without noticing by Ridha. I went to Vvian's bedroom and it was a bit messy.
                "What happened to your bedroom?" I spoke out.
                "Oh, I had alot of work to do! Why did you ask?"
                "No reason," I said, walking around the dirty bedroom.
